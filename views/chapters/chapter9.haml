  ### Chapter 9

  So, web development is awesome. However, of fourty odd people enrolling on my first day of Computer Science, I counted three girls. Three. That’s not awesome. The web needs more female developers. So I implore you, lady designers, dip a toe in the pool of web development. The water is warm. **And please don’t let things like this stop you.**

  This is just no.

  The propagation of lame movements like **brogramming**, in my mind, only serve to further alienates very awesome and very interesting people from getting involved in the community. We need to create working environments that are open, inclusive and welcoming. Brogramming, like sexism and homophobia and all those dumb things, **is super uncool.**

  I implore you to get involved with web development, and not to let stuff like this stop you. **Embrace the code!** Start building more fantastic things. Like I said, it will make the cogs of the universe turn a little more joyously.
